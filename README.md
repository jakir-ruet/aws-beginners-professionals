### AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional

This is designed for individuals who have experience working in a DevOps role and using AWS services. This certification validates your knowledge and skills in various areas related to implementing and managing continuous delivery systems and methodologies on the AWS platform. Key topics covered in the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional exam include:

- ***SDLC Automation:*** Implementing and managing continuous delivery systems and methodologies.
- ***Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code (IaC):*** Implementing and managing the deployment pipeline, including infrastructure as code (IaC).
- ***Monitoring and Logging:*** Implementing monitoring and logging systems on AWS.
- ***Policies and Standards Automation:*** Implementing systems that are highly available, scalable, and self-healing on the AWS platform.
- ***Incident and Event Response:*** Designing, managing, and maintaining tools to automate operational processes.
To prepare for the exam, it's recommended to have hands-on experience with various AWS services and understand how to design, manage, and maintain tools for automating operational processes. Additionally, reviewing the official exam guide provided by AWS, along with relevant AWS documentation and whitepapers, can help you prepare effectively.
#### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

#### [Types of Cloud Computing Deployment Models](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)
- [Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/private-cloud/#:~:text=A%20private%20cloud%20is%20a,the%20control%20of%20one%20organization.)
  - This service used by a single organization, not exposed to public.
  - Complete self control
  - Secure for senserive applications.
  - Fulfill specified requirements.
  - For example [RackSpace](https://www.rackspace.com), [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.hpe.com/emea_europe/en/home.html) and so on.
- Public Cloud
  - Cloud resources owned and operated by a third- party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
  - [Six Advantages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html) of Cloud Computing.
    - Trade fixed expense (Capital Expense - ***CapEx***) for variable expense (Operational Expense - OpEx).
      - Pay on demand: Don't own hardware.
      - Reduce Total Cost of Owership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OpEx).
    - Benefit from massive economies of scale
      - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
    - Stop guessing capacity
      - Scale based on actual measured usage
    - Increase speed and agility
    - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    - Go global in minutes
  - For example AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) & Microsoft Azure.
- [Hybrid Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/hybrid/)
  - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
  - Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
  - Flexibility and cost- effectiveness of the public cloud
  - For example, On-premises with Public cloud.

#### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-demand self service:
   Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
2. Broad network access:
   Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
   Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
   Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability:
   Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
   Quickly and easily scale based on demand
5. Measured service:
   Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

#### Problems solved by the Cloud
- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

#### [Types of Cloud Computing Model](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - Highest level of flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
  - For example
    - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
    - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  - For example
    - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
    - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
  - For example
    - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
    - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom
##### Cloud Computing Model

#### Price of Cloud
AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
1. Compute: Pay for compute time
2. Storage: Pay for data stored in the Cloud
3. Data transfer out of the Cloud: Data transfer IN is free
Its the expensive issue then traditional IT


  AWS CLI
   - Control multiple AWS services from this command line.
   - How to [Install?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
   - Let's me check `aws --version`
   - If its okay then we will see `aws-cli/2.15.4 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.2.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off`
   - Configuration using security credential
     - Go to AWS Management Console > Services > IAM
     - Select the IAM User Name: Your User Name [_**NB**_: You must use IAM's Information only not Root User]
     - Click on `Security credentials`
     - Click on `Create access key`
     - Copy Access ID & Secret access key
     - Go to your Terminal and implement as below format
     - `aws configure`
     - AWS Access Key ID [None]: Put your ID here and press Enter.
     - AWS Secret Access Key [None]: Put your secret key here and press Enter
     - Default region name [None]: us-east-1
     - Default output format [None]: json
   - Let's me check whether the configuration is done.
     - `aws ec2 describe-vpcs`
     - If it is done then we will see the details of the default vpc.
