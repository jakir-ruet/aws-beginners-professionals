## üîÑ PROCESS
Scrum is an Agile framework where work is delivered in short, time-boxed iterations and Sprints. Each Sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and continuously improve.

## üë• ROLES IN SCRUM

### Product Owner (PO)
- Represents the voice of the customer.  
- Manages and prioritizes the Product Backlog.  
- Ensures the team builds the right product.  
- **Core Responsibility:** Communication and Value Maximization  

### Scrum Master (SM)
- Servant-leader and facilitator for the team.  
- Ensures Scrum principles are followed.  
- Removes impediments and shields the team from distractions.  
- **Core Responsibility:** Scrum implementation and process improvement  

### The Team
- Self-organizing, cross-functional group (3‚Äì9 members).  
- Responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments every Sprint.  
- **Core Responsibility:** Delivering high-quality work  

## ‚è±Ô∏è ITERATIONS (SPRINTS)
- Sprints are time-boxed iterations where a fixed scope of work is executed.  
- **Typical Length:** 1‚Äì4 weeks  
- Once a Sprint starts, the scope is **locked**; new tasks cannot be added.  
- **Outcome:** A working product increment that could be released.

## üìè ESTIMATION
Estimation helps teams plan and forecast future work.  
Can be done in:
- **Hours** ‚Äì Used for precise task duration  
- **Story Points** ‚Äì Abstract measure based on complexity, risk, and effort  
*Done during backlog refinement or Sprint Planning*

## üß± SCOPE LIMITS
- The Sprint scope is limited to the team‚Äôs capacity.  
- Over committing or introducing new work mid-Sprint is discouraged.  
- Focus is on maintaining sustainable pace and delivery quality.

## üß© SCRUM EVENTS / MEETINGS

### Sprint Planning
- Held at the start of a Sprint (usually 1‚Äì2 hours per week of Sprint length).  
- The team and PO agree on the Sprint Goal and the work needed to achieve it.

### Daily Scrum (Stand-up)
- 15-minute daily sync to inspect progress and adapt the plan.  
- Team members answer:  
  - What did I do yesterday?  
  - What will I do today?  
  - Are there any impediments?

### Sprint Review
- Held at the end of the Sprint.  
- The team demos the increment to stakeholders and collects feedback.  
- Helps guide future backlog items.

### Sprint Retrospective
- Held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.  
- Focuses on **process improvement**.  
- Discusses:  
  - What went well?  
  - What didn‚Äôt?  
  - What can be improved?

## üìå PRIORITIZATION
Managed by the **Product Owner**.  
Items in the Product Backlog are ordered based on:
- Customer value  
- Risk/complexity  
- Dependencies  
- Time sensitivity  
*Helps the team stay focused on high-impact work.*

## üìã BOARD (TASK TRACKING)
A typical Scrum board has four key sections:
1. **Product Backlog** ‚Äì All features, fixes, and requirements (not yet selected for Sprint).  
2. **Sprint Backlog** ‚Äì Work selected for the current Sprint.  
3. **Doing** ‚Äì Tasks currently in progress.  
4. **Done** ‚Äì Completed tasks or stories.  

Boards can be:
- Physical (whiteboards with sticky notes)  
- Digital (e.g., Jira, Trello, Azure Boards)

## üìò KEY SCRUM TERMS

### Product Backlog
A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes maintained by the PO.

### Sprint Backlog
A subset of the Product Backlog selected for a Sprint, broken into tasks by the team.

### Story Point
A relative unit for estimating effort, used instead of hours to avoid bias and promote velocity tracking.

### User Story
A short description of functionality from the user's perspective:  
*"As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."*

### Burndown Chart
A visual tool showing remaining work in the Sprint over time.  
Helps track progress and identify bottlenecks.

### Team Velocity
The average number of story points a team can complete in a Sprint.  
Useful for forecasting future Sprints.
