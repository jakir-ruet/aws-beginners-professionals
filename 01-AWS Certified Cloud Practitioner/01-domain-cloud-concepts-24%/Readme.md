##### [Types of Cloud Computing Deployment Models](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)
- [Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/private-cloud/#:~:text=A%20private%20cloud%20is%20a,the%20control%20of%20one%20organization.)
  - This service used by a single organization, not exposed to public.
  - Complete self control
  - Secure for sensitive applications.
  - Fulfill specified requirements.
  - For example [RackSpace](https://www.rackspace.com), [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.hpe.com/emea_europe/en/home.html) and so on.
- Public Cloud
  - Cloud resources owned and operated by a third- party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
  - [Six Advantages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html) of Cloud Computing.
    - Trade fixed expense (Capital Expense - ***CapEx***) for variable expense (Operational Expense - ***OpEx***).

##### Cloud Computing Model
![Cloud Computing Model](/img/cloud-computing-model.png)

##### Highly Available and Scalable Resources
High availability means your application or service remains **accessible and operational** even when one or more components fail. Key Features:
- Redundancy
- Failover mechanisms
- Health checks and monitoring

AWS Services Supporting High Availability:
| Service                         | High Availability Feature                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon EC2**                  | Use Auto Scaling + Load Balancer across AZs       |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** | Distributes traffic across multiple instances/AZs |
| **Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)**       | Automatic failover to standby instance            |
| **Amazon S3**                   | Stores data across multiple AZs                   |
| **Route 53**                    | DNS-level failover and health checks              |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**             | Automatically replicates data across multiple AZs |

##### Scalability vs Elasticity
Both Scalability and Elasticity are core cloud concepts that help applications handle varying loads efficiently — but they are `not the same` thing.

###### Scalability
The ability of a system to increase or decrease its capacity (usually compute, storage, or throughput) based on workload. Types of Scalability:
- Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down)
  - Add more power (CPU/RAM) to an existing instance.
  - Example: Change an EC2 instance from `t2.micro` to `t3.large`.
- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In)
  - Add or remove multiple instances to distribute the load.
  - Example: Add more EC2 instances to a load balancer group.

- AWS Services That Support Scalability:
  - EC2 Auto Scaling
  - Elastic Load Balancing
  - Amazon RDS (Read Replicas for horizontal read scalability)
  - Amazon DynamoDB (auto scaling read/write capacity)

###### Elasticity
The ability of the system to automatically adjust capacity to maintain performance as demand changes in real-time. Think of it as automated and reactive scalability.
- AWS Services That Provide Elasticity:
  - EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): Automatically increase/decrease EC2 instances based on demand.
  - AWS Lambda: Automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests.
  - Amazon Aurora Serverless: Automatically adjusts database capacity.

**Key Differences Between Scalability and Elasticity**
| Feature        | Scalability                              | Elasticity                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Focus          | Capacity expansion                       | Real-time responsiveness                   |
| Trigger        | Manual or rule-based                     | Automated and reactive                     |
| Example        | Add more EC2 instances with Auto Scaling | Lambda scales automatically with requests  |
| Resource Usage | Grows with load (needs configuration)    | Expands/contracts on demand without effort |

###### Agility in AWS
**Agility** in cloud computing refers to the ability to **quickly adapt** to changes in demand or business needs by leveraging scalable, flexible, and automated cloud resources. In AWS, agility allows businesses to deploy, scale, and modify their infrastructure with minimal time and effort.

**Agility vs Traditional IT**
| Aspect           | Traditional IT                         | Cloud Agility (AWS)                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Deployment Speed | Slow, manual provisioning of hardware  | Fast, automated resource provisioning |
| Scalability      | Limited by hardware, requires planning | Auto-scaling based on demand          |
| Flexibility      | Difficult to change configurations     | Easily adaptable to meet new needs    |
| Cost Efficiency  | High upfront costs                     | Pay-as-you-go, no upfront investment  |

**Key Features of Agility**
- `Rapid Deployment:` Launch services, applications, and infrastructure quickly without needing to wait for physical hardware or lengthy configuration processes.
- `Flexibility and Adaptability:` Change infrastructure configurations in real-time to meet new demands or operational requirements.
- `Cost Efficiency:` Only pay for what you use, enabling teams to experiment with new ideas without worrying about upfront costs.
- `Automation:` Automate resource management and application deployment to save time and reduce human error.

##### [Cloud Economics](https://aws.amazon.com/economics/)
Cloud economics refers to the financial principles and business value derived from cloud computing. It helps organizations understand how to optimize costs, `improve return on investment (ROI)`, and maximize the value of cloud adoption.

##### Price of Cloud
AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
1. Compute: Pay for compute time
2. Storage: Pay for data stored in the Cloud
3. Data transfer out of the Cloud: Data transfer IN is free
Its the expensive issue then traditional IT

###### Core Aspects/Concepts of Cloud Economics
1. Pay-as-You-Go Pricing
   - You only pay for what you use (compute, storage, bandwidth, etc.).
   - No need for large upfront capital expenditures (CAPEX).
   - Costs become operational expenses (OPEX), which can be easier to manage and scale.
   - ![Understanding the difference between Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operational Expenses (OPEX) is crucial when comparing traditional IT to cloud-based models.](/img/capex-opex.png)
2. Elasticity & Scalability
   - Automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
   - Reduces over-provisioning and avoids paying for unused infrastructure.
   - Helps manage seasonal spikes and fluctuating workloads efficiently.
3. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
   - TCO in the cloud includes infrastructure, software, support, labor, and training.
   - Cloud often lowers TCO by reducing hardware costs, energy consumption, and maintenance.
4. Return on Investment (ROI)
   - Cloud accelerates time-to-market, drives innovation, and enhances customer experiences—leading to higher ROI.
   - Faster provisioning and deployment can unlock revenue sooner.
5. Economies of Scale
   - Cloud providers like AWS serve millions of customers, enabling them to offer lower prices due to scale.
   - Over time, cloud costs often decrease as providers pass on savings.
6. Cost Transparency & Management
   - Cloud platforms provide tools for real-time monitoring, usage reports, and alerts.
   - Services like AWS Cost Explorer or AWS Budgets help optimize spending and identify waste.
7. Consumption-Based Forecasting
   - Budgeting in the cloud shifts from fixed infrastructure costs to demand-based forecasting.
   - Enables more agile and accurate financial planning.

###### BYOL (Bring Your Own License)?
BYOL is a licensing model that lets you use your existing software licenses (like Windows, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) when migrating or deploying workloads on AWS. Instead of buying new licenses through AWS, you "bring" the ones you already own—usually through volume licensing agreements from Microsoft, Oracle, etc.

###### Benefits of Automation (e.g., AWS CloudFormation)
- Faster deployments: Automate the creation and management of infrastructure.
- Consistency: Reduce errors by using templates.
- Scalability: Easily replicate environments.
- Better management: Track changes with version control.
- Example: AWS CloudFormation lets you define your entire infrastructure in code (Infrastructure as Code, or IaC).

###### Managed AWS Services
These are services where AWS handles maintenance, scaling, and patching so you don’t have to.
- Amazon RDS: Managed relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Amazon ECS: Run and manage Docker containers.
- Amazon EKS: Managed Kubernetes service.
- Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database service, fully managed and serverless.

**Why Use Managed Services?**
- Lower operational overhead.
- Built-in scalability and reliability.
- Focus more on business logic, not infrastructure.
