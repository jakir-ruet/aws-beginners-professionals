#### 01 Domain - Cloud Concepts
##### Overview 
This domain ensures you understand what the `cloud` is, why `organizations` use AWS, and how `cloud economics` and `design principles` apply to `real-world` scenarios.

- `Task Statement 1.1:` Benefits of the AWS Cloud such as
  - Cost Savings: No upfront investment, pay-as-you-go.
  - Elasticity: Automatically scale resources up/down as needed.
  - Global Reach: Deploy globally in minutes using AWS Regions.
  - High Availability: Design fault-tolerant applications with built-in redundancy.
  - Agility: Experiment quickly using managed services and templates.

- `Task Statement 1.2:` AWS Cloud Design Principles. AWS Well-Architected Framework – `6 Pillars`:
   - Operational Excellence – Monitoring, automation, and continuous improvement.
   - Security – Protecting data, systems, and assets.
   - Reliability – System recovery, failure management.
   - Performance Efficiency – Use right resources and adapt to changing needs.
   - Cost Optimization – Avoid unnecessary costs and optimize spend.
   - Sustainability – Environmental impact and energy efficiency.

- `Task Statement 1.3:` Migration Strategies and Benefits. Key Concepts:
  - AWS CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework): Provides guidance on migrating workloads. 
    - Benefits of CAF:
      - Increased business agility
      - Reduced risk and operational overhead
      - ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) improvements
      - Common Migration Tools:
  - AWS Snowball – Move large data sets securely.
  - AWS DMS – Database migration service.

- `Task Statement 1.4:` Cloud Economics. Key Concepts:
  - CapEx vs. OpEx:
  - Traditional IT: Capital Expenditure (hardware)
  - Cloud: Operational Expenditure (usage-based)
  - Rightsizing: Match resources to workload needs.
  - Automation: Use services like CloudFormation for repeatable infrastructure.
  - Licensing: Choose between `Bring Your Own License` (BYOL) or AWS-provided.
  - Examples of Managed Services:
    - Amazon RDS – Managed relational databases
    - Amazon ECS/EKS – Managed container orchestration
    - Amazon DynamoDB – Managed NoSQL database
