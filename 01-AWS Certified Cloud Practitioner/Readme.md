### Welcome to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Exam Guide
#### Introduction
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is designed for individuals who can demonstrate foundational knowledge of the AWS Cloud, independent of a specific job role. The exam validates a candidate’s ability to complete the following tasks: 
- Explain the value of the AWS Cloud. 
- Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model. 
- Understand security best practices. 
- Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices. 
- Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, database, and storage services. 
- Identify AWS services for common use cases.

#### Target Candidate
The target candidate has up to 6 months of exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and/or operations. This certification is ideal for candidates who are from non-IT backgrounds. These candidates might be in the early stages of pursuing an AWS Cloud career or might work with people in AWS Cloud roles. 

#### Recommended AWS Knowledge 
The target candidate should have AWS knowledge in the following areas: 
- AWS Cloud concepts 
- Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud 
- Core AWS services 
- Economics of the AWS Cloud

#### Not Need to Know (Job tasks that are out of scope for the target candidate)
The following list contains job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be able to 
perform. This list is non-exhaustive. These tasks are out of scope for the exam: 
- Coding 
- Cloud architecture design 
- Troubleshooting 
- Implementation 
- Load and performance testing 
Refer to `Appendix A` for a list of technologies and concepts that might appear on the exam, a list of in-scope AWS services and features, and a list of out-of-scope AWS services and features.

#### Exam Content 
Response types `>` There are two types of questions on the exam: 
- `Multiple choice:` Has `one correct` response and three incorrect responses (distractors) 
- `Multiple response:` Has `two or more correct` responses out of five or more response 
options

`Instructions`
- Select one or more responses that `best complete` the statement or answer the question.
- Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose.

#### 01 Domain - Cloud Concepts
##### Overview 
This domain ensures you understand what the `cloud` is, why `organizations` use AWS, and how `cloud economics` and `design principles` apply to `real-world` scenarios.

- `Task Statement 1.1:` Benefits of the AWS Cloud such as
  - Cost Savings: No upfront investment, pay-as-you-go.
  - Elasticity: Automatically scale resources up/down as needed.
  - Global Reach: Deploy globally in minutes using AWS Regions.
  - High Availability: Design fault-tolerant applications with built-in redundancy.
  - Agility: Experiment quickly using managed services and templates.

- `Task Statement 1.2:` AWS Cloud Design Principles. AWS Well-Architected Framework – `6 Pillars`:
   - Operational Excellence – Monitoring, automation, and continuous improvement.
   - Security – Protecting data, systems, and assets.
   - Reliability – System recovery, failure management.
   - Performance Efficiency – Use right resources and adapt to changing needs.
   - Cost Optimization – Avoid unnecessary costs and optimize spend.
   - Sustainability – Environmental impact and energy efficiency.

- `Task Statement 1.3:` Migration Strategies and Benefits. Key Concepts:
  - AWS CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework): Provides guidance on migrating workloads. 
    - Benefits of CAF:
      - Increased business agility
      - Reduced risk and operational overhead
      - ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) improvements
      - Common Migration Tools:
  - AWS Snowball – Move large data sets securely.
  - AWS DMS – Database migration service.

- `Task Statement 1.4:` Cloud Economics. Key Concepts:
  - CapEx vs. OpEx:
  - Traditional IT: Capital Expenditure (hardware)
  - Cloud: Operational Expenditure (usage-based)
  - Rightsizing: Match resources to workload needs.
  - Automation: Use services like CloudFormation for repeatable infrastructure.
  - Licensing: Choose between `Bring Your Own License` (BYOL) or AWS-provided.
  - Examples of Managed Services:
    - Amazon RDS – Managed relational databases
    - Amazon ECS/EKS – Managed container orchestration
    - Amazon DynamoDB – Managed NoSQL database
