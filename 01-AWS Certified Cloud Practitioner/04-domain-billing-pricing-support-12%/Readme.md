#### 04 Domain - [Billing Pricing Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html)
AWS Billing and Pricing to get you started or help clarify things. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You pay only for the services you use, for as long as you use them, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. Let me know if you're looking for something more specific.

##### Key Pricing Models
- On-Demand Pricing
   - Pay for compute or storage by the hour or second (depending on the service).
   - No long-term commitments.
   - Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads.
- Reserved Instances (RIs)
   - Commit to a specific instance type in a region for a 1- or 3-year term.
   - Up to 75% discount over on-demand.
   - Best for steady-state usage (e.g., databases, always-on apps).
- Savings Plans
   - Flexible pricing model offering lower prices compared to on-demand in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3-year term.
   - More flexible than RIs.
- Spot Instances
   - Purchase unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% off the on-demand price.
   - Great for fault-tolerant or flexible apps.
