[Continuos Integration/Continuos Development (CI/CD)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cicd_for_5g_networks_on_aws/cicd-on-aws.html)

It's a software development practice aimed at improving the quality and speed of software delivery. CI/CD pipelines are often implemented using various tools and technologies such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others. These tools automate the stages of building, testing, and deployment, enabling development teams to release software more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. We could complete the CI/CD in seven steps.
