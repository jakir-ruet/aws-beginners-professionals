[Continuos Integration/Continuos Development (CI/CD)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cicd_for_5g_networks_on_aws/cicd-on-aws.html)
It's a software development practice aimed at improving the quality and speed of software delivery. CI/CD pipelines are often implemented using various tools and technologies such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others. These tools automate the stages of building, testing, and deployment, enabling development teams to release software more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. We could complete the CI/CD in seven steps.
- ***AWS CodeCommit*** > Storing source code (AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, BitBucket etc.).
- ***AWS CodePipeline*** > Automating pipeline from source code to Elastic Beanstalk & others (Orchestrate Using From Here).
- ***AWS CodeBuild*** > Building & testing source code (AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins etc.).
- ***AWS CodeDeploy*** > Deploying source code (AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Beanstalk, EC2 Instance, On-Premises Instance, AWS Lambda, AWS ECS etc.). 
- ***AWS CodeStar*** > Manage software development activities such as quick develop, build & deploy, in one place
- ***AWS Code Artifact*** > Store, publish, and share software packages to the end point.
- ***AWS CodeGuru*** â€“ automated code reviews using Machine Learning
